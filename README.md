# Express Lists

## Introduction

This is a fully RESTful Express app, that includes full CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update and Delete) and Express authentication.

## Description

* Contains one model (list)
* Full CRUD actions
* Fully RESTful
* Includes a seeds file
* Is responsive

## Style

Styling it up using Bulma and pure flexbox

## Express Authentication

I have added session authentication so that you can register a new user and login. 

* I have secured the `new`, `create`, `edit`, `update` and `delete` routes, so that only logged in users perform those actions.
* I have hidden the edit and delete buttons if you're not logged in.
* Added flash messages.
